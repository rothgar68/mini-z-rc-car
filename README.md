**Check the Wiki for updates and a list of components!**

Aug 30, 2018 - Added updated rear spring/body clip combo (body-clip-rear-v2.stl).

Aug 16, 2018 - Added an updated steer-link-v10, more durable with more toe-in.

Aug 15, 2018 - Added more axle spacers for the wider axle.

Aug 14, 2018 - Added rear body clip to replace the spring on the motormount, and new front bumber with body clip.

Aug 14, 2018 - Added body-05.stl - this is the form used to thermoform the bodies. I was able to pull a couple from a variety of materials, and polycarb seemed to work best, with styrene not bad. Petg was the most difficult at .020 thickness.

Aug 8, 2018 - Updated chassis, new spindle and steering arm for tighter steering. Added front bumper (note: you'll have to print a mirror of the new spindle.)

July 31, 2018 - Updated motormount: added block to keep motor from rotating.

July 28, 2018 - Updated chassis: wider platform, moved servo further forward to center the battery more. Updated the spindles.
